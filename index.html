<!----
Your name
A short bio, no more than 10 or so words.
A picture. This can be a picture of you, some graphics to represent your field of focus, or anything you think is appropriate.
In addition, create a CSS file, and make sure your HTML properly loads the CSS. In the newly created CSS file, write code so the following specifications are satisfied:

Your name is displayed in a large (> 30px) font, in a dark color (< #404040)
Your bio has a font size smaller than your name, and a thinner color.
Your name and bio uses a font imported from Google Fonts.
In desktop, your picture is placed adjacent to your name and bio. In other words, do not simply stack your name, bio, and pictures vertically. This is where CSS grid may come to help.
On mobile devices, your name, bio, and pictures are stacked vertically, so it can fit on vertically long screens.
Your webpage, name, bio, and photo has appropriate margins set so they don't touch each other.----!>
